## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- In the video from this section, the concept of the 'The Brilliant Developer' was referred to during the interview with Carmen. It was a relief to hear about this stereotype from an established software developer, as I have also struggled with this idea as an outsider to the field. It actually prevented me from pursuing an education as a programmer for many years. I assumed only incredibly smart, perfect and _brilliant_ individuals could be successful here, and who was I to believe I lived up to that standard? It was only through a slow line of questioning that I began to see that _anyone_ can do anything, and that we are all just people. We have the right to pursue what inspires us and makes us feel curious, _~~even if~~ especially if_ it pushes the boundaries of what we thought we were capable of. In that way, I suppose the growth mindset lives in me. Because I believe that we all have something to contribute, and we all have the ability to develop skills in order to access and demonstrate that contribution. 

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- Taking the step to enroll in Turing was a moment of growth for me. I simply became curious about something, and allowed myself to explore it. My background is completely unrelated, as I had established a career in spiritual/massage/energy work. Some resisted when I told them I was interested in programming, however I knew I was capable of developing these skills with the right support. However, I certainly have room to grow in this area. It is still apparent to me that when faced with the feeling of 'making a mistake' and 'doing something wrong' I can fairly easily panic. I'm looking forward to this experience as I believe I will have a lot of practice making those error messages my friends. :)


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- Personally, I sort of liked it. There was a concept I was introduced to at the beginning of section 2 called ZPD (zone of proximal development.) I have thought of this several times since beginning Mod 0, and it comes to me often when working with these exercises. Some of the articles introduced have served to explain some of the mindsets and ideas that Turing employs and promotes during their curriculum. It feels pretty obvious to me that ZPD is something they continually have in mind when developing these excercises. It keeps us learning and growing while slightly reaching past our level of comfort. I'm very excited about it! But it's challening in the sense of sometimes not knowing if you're behind, if you should know something that you don't currently, and it can feel overwhelming. But it supported me in finding my own way and troubleshooting the simple issues. 


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.



5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
