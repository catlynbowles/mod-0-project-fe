## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The first point that resonated with me was pointed to in the Growth Mindset video. She started by explaining this underlying myth of 'The Brilliant Developer.' I myself have struggled because of the existence of this stereotype. I can now even see the ways it prevented me from pursuing software development for so many years. I assumed only incredibly smart, perfect and _brilliant_ individuals would pursue such a thing, and who was I to believe I could fit in there? It was only through a slow line of questioning myself, and the way I viewed myself in comparison to others that I began to see that _anyone_ can do anything. I suppose that's a point of the Growth Mindset that I've come to believe. That we all have something unique to contribute, and that with the right guidance we can all learn a new skillset that can display that contribution. 


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think being enrolled in Turing, for me personally, demonstrates a Growth Mindset. I didn't come from a technical background, I was never told that I would be a great programmer, I simply came to believe that I could learn anything, and I allowed myself to be curious instead of judgemental about trying something new. However, I certainly have room to grow in this area. It is still apparent to me that when faced with the feeling of 'making a mistake' and 'doing something wrong' i can potentially enter into a place of panic and 'stuck.' It is something I will continue to be aware of and learn to push past as it comes. 


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Personally, I sort of liked it. There was a concept I was introduced to at the beginning of section 2 called ZPD (zone of proximal development.) I have thought of this several times since beginning Mod 0, and it comes to me often when working with these exercises. Some of the articles introduced have served to explain some of the mindsets and ideas that Turing employs and promotes during their curriculum. It feels pretty obvious to me that ZPD is something they continually have in mind when developing these excercises. It keeps us learning and growing while slightly reaching past our level of comfort. I'm very excited about it! But it's challening in the sense of sometimes not knowing if you're behind, if you should know something that you don't currently, and it can feel overwhelming. But it supported me in finding my own way and troubleshooting the simple issues. 


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.



5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
