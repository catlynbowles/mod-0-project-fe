## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
- I felt more challenged and there was a few times it was a little uncomfortable, but overall I'd say it went okay. There were a couple funky things that I didn't really understand about why my code was doing what, so it would have been nice to have a little class time dedicated to just airing out some of the things from the mod0 project. 
2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- One place where they use many arrays is in any music app, like Spotify or Apple Music. There are arrays to organize genres, albums, playlists, artists, and a host of other different organizational arrays. 
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is used to manipulate a array, including adding, deleting or changing the elements within it. 
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop is used to repeat something, perhaps an action, logging a string of code, or a countdown you'd like to visualize. You would use an array in conjunction with a loop if you were working with a group of specific elements to be included. You would not need an array if you were working with a simple example, such as asking the console to log the numbers 1-100. 
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Loops are used for anything we have to do repetitively. If the 5 year old knew about Homer Simpson, I would refer to the way that Homer Simpson has to write a sentence on the chalkboard 100 times everytime when he gets into trouble. Now, we can also do that on a computer. But instead of wasting all that time manually writing out the sentences 100 times, we could write a loop that could make our computer do it for us, saving us time and energy. 
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I guess I sort of would like a little more background on how to combine the elements of arrays, loops, variables, and 'if' statements etc. I definitely need more practice with it!
